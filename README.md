Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
Nestor Escobedo  
This project is a tokenizer that lets the user input strings and allows them
to view the tokens generated of the string provided, it also allows the user
to keep a history record of the strings which were input.

The project uses three main files to handle the strings and history:
-Tokenize.c
-history.c
-gui.c

When the project is run with the "make project" command the user will see a ">"
sign so he can input the strings.
